Different ways to contribute to this library?
---------------------------------------------

You can contribute by -

(1) Improving or adding documentation - Documentation is the heart of any publicly available code library. It helps people understand the library and makes it easy to use. Our goal is to make it easily consumable. If you find something missing, incorrect or inappropriate in the documentation, in any part of library, and you know the better way, feel free to contribute.

(2) Adding/improving example codes - If you have a working example code and proper description supporting it which you have created using the library, please contribute it so that other developers can use it.

(3) Improving the core library - You have a better algorithm, architecture or even simple quick working code that can enhance the existing core library, please contrbute.

(4) Raising issues and bugs - If you have found an edge case or unhandled scenario for certain input or execution environment configuration and you have done several tests for the same. Please report this on Github as an issue. If you can submit the code its great! Even if you cannot, don't worry, it will be taken care by the development team.

What things are needed to start contributing?
---------------------------------------------

Three things - source code of library (which you already have), your changes and git.

How to?

Add and commit them to your local repository (using 'git add' and 'git commit') with proper description in commit message. Create a patch (using 'git diff').

Email it to one of the maintainers from the MAINTAINERS file with proper subject and body with detailed description supporting the patch.
